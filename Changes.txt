Changes History

Up to, and including, version 1.04 the application was called Disc Image Reader and was compiled on Delphi for Windows only. The DiscImage unit had it's own version number and had reached version 1.10.

Version 1.04 was then used to migrate across to Lazarus and compile on macOS.

1.05
* First macOS version.
* First version to appear on GitHub.
* A few spurious bugs had crept in from the conversion - disc sizes were reported as 0 bytes and the main window became sizeable.
* StatusBar update no longer functions.

1.05.1
* Code tidied up and compatibility Delphi removed. Now completely Object Free Pascal.
* Compiled for Windows and Linux.
* Version numbers now remain at 1.05 with revision number following.

1.05.2
* Main window is no longer sizeable, and you only now have the close button.
* Buttons are disabled when not needed, and enabled when they can be used.
* Extracted files now come with an .inf file.
* Hint for the extract file button changed from "Download File" to "Extract File(s)"
* Pop-up menu item for "Extract File" changed to "Extract File(s)"
* Now developed and distributed under the GNU GPL v3 licence.
* About dialogue window changed to reflect new licence and GitHub web address.

1.05.3
* Reverted the main window to sizeable.
* Reverted to the window system icons (maximise and minimise)
* Set the initial main window size to 921x751px
* Changed the search panel around so that the search results grows and shrinks with the main window resizing.
* .inf files only now produced for DFS and ADFS
* Facility to save images back to disc added (the code had been written just not attached to any buttons or menus)
* Files can now be added to a DFS image

1.05.4
* Tidy up of some code.
* Buttons moved to a ToolBar (along the top).
* Disc Info panel moved to the Status Bar (along the bottom).
* Progress parameter removed from DiscImage unit.
* Fixed a bug where the extra Watford DFS entries would get written to the wrong places.
* Buttons added to the ToolBar: Add Files, Rename File, Delete File.
* Can now rename a DFS file.
* Can now delete DFS file(s).
* File attributes no longer displayed next to the filename in the File Details panel but have been moved to tick boxes at the bottom of the panel.
* File Details panel tidied up: fields have been moved closer together, reducing the overall size of the panel.
* File attributes can now be changed, for DFS files.

1.05.5
* Added button for new, blank, image.
* Added dialogue box to create and format new image.
* Fixed a bug where saving an image does not update the filename.
* Tidy up of code.
* Fixed a bug where the wrong default extension was added when saving an image when the extension was not specified.
* Added an 'image has changed/not been saved' tracker.
* Extended the status bar to add in a 'image has changed/not been saved' indicator.
* Spread the attributes out as they were on over the top of each other in Linux.
* Status Bar is now blank with no or unknown image type.
* Spread the file details out again, and resized the labels.
* Binaries compiled in 'Release' mode to reduce final file size and increase execution speed.

1.05.6
* Fixed a bug where extracting a file from an ADFS image, where the file's indirect address was the same as the offset to the root, the root would be saved instead (and repeated for the length of the file).
* Fixed a bug where if a directory was selected as part of a multi-selection, and this directories contents where also selected, only the directory would be downloaded. Previously the contents would be downloaded twice.
* Fixed a bug where ADFS L images (*.adl) were not read interleaved, causing data corruption.
* Fixed a bug where creating a new double sided DFS image, then writing to it, will cause the data to get written to the image as if it is a single sided image.
* Adding files will now skip over *.inf files.
* Images can be opened by dragging them into the application window.
* Files can be added to images by dragging them into the application window.
* Command line commands added - this is a work in progress.

* Free space is now calculated from the free space map and not by adding up the length of files and directories.

1.05.8
* ADFS old map discs were being IDed wrongly, based on inaccurate information. This has been fixed.
* Small bug with calculating the free-space map fixed.
* A bug where extraenous spaces were not removed from the end of the disc title has been fixed.
* In an attempt to get the colours uniform across platforms, they have been changed from a platform specific colour to a standard colour.
* Fixed a bug where selecting an item from the search window will result in a purple box on the file details section.
* If an ADFS directory check byte is zero, this is now ignored.
* Added facility to create a new, blank, ADFS floppy disc image.
* More improvements on the ADFS ID process - if an image has a boot block (F, F+ and some Hard Discs) then it will have a checksum. This is now checked.
* Added facility to re-title an ADFS image.
* Added facility to change boot option on an ADFS image.
