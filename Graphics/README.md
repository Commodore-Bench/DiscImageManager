RISC OS Filetypes have been taken from RISC OS 5.28 sprite files (Raspberry theme, Sprites11 file), and processed through another of my projects, Sprite Convertor (also on GitHub).
The graphics for non-RISC OS files were taken from eariler versions of RISC OS and went through the same process.<br>
Buttons and icons make use of various RISC OS filetype or application sprites, combined with free-to-use or public domain graphics found online. They were combined using Adobe Photoshop.<br>
Where one was produced, an Adobe Photoshop file has been included in this repository.<br>
