ADFS Free Space
---------------

New Map
-------
FreeLink (bytes 01 and 02) - reset top bit (this is a terminating bit - idlen + 1)...this is the number of bits from this link where the first free fragment in the zone resides. Here you may find another counter of number of bits from this point to the next free fragment (in that zone), or 0 if there are no more. Following these is the usual series of zero bits, marking free space (including the marker), until you hit a high bit marking the end of that free fragment.

Fragment IDs only need to be unique, and don't need to be consecutive.

Old Map
-------
This is just a table of free space areas (FreeStart), and another table of how long each area is (FreeLen). The first table points to the sector number, while the second number is how many sectors long it is. FreeEnd is a single byte indicator to how long, in bytes, the lists are (multiple of 3, as each table is 3 bytes per entry).
