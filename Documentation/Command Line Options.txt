Command line options

Commands take the form <command>:<parameter1>|<parameter2>|...
Parameters in square brackets [] indicate optional parameters.
Any parameters containing spaces should be contained within double quotes (").
Any unrecognised commands, or insufficient number of parameters, will be ignored.

--add -a Add files to the image
Parameters: <OS filename>[|<destination>][|<FS filename>][|<load address>][|<execution address>][|<attributes>]
Adds files specified in <OS filename>, which can be wildcarded, to the open image in <destination> directory. Assumes drive 0 and root if nothing selected or not found. The filename to be used on the image can also be specified, along with the load address, execution address and attributes. Addresses should be in hex, and the attributes can either be in hex or as text as per access command below. If the optional parameters are specified, then this overrides anything contained within the related 'inf' file, if this exists.

--access -ac Set attributes for specified file
Parameters: <FS filename>|<attributes>
Sets the attributes (access rights) to the file or directory specified. <attributes> can be a string containing any, or all, of the following (in any order):
Bit	Attribute	Meaning
0	R		Owner Read
1	W		Owner Write
2	L		Owner Locked
3	E		Owner Execute only
4	r		Public Read
5	w		Public Write
6	e		Public Execute only
7	P		Private
Not all attributes are available on all file systems, so only those relevant to the system will be used. Instead of a string, a hex value can also be passed (using the bit value in the first column).
This will be expanded to take account of Commodore 64 and Amiga access rights.

--cmdfile -f Read an execute commands from a text file
Parameters:<filename>
Reads and executes commands held in a text file <filename>. Commands will be those listed here and can include this command.

--create -c Create new directory
Parameters: [<newdir>]|[<parentdir>]
Creates a new directory, <newdir>, in the currently open image as a child of <parentdir>. If <parentdir> is not specified, then the root will be used. If <newdir> is not specified then a default name will be given (usually 'NewDir' plus a number).

--delete -d Delete file or directory
Parameters:<filename>
Deletes a file/directory from inside the currently open image.

--dirtitle -dt Set directory title
Parameters:<dirname>|<title>
Sets the directory title for the specified directory.

--extract -e Extract files or directories
Parameters:<filename>
Extracts file(s) specified in <filename> to the local OS path.

--insert -i Open image file
Parameters:<filename>
Opens image file <filename> from the host operating system. If it is not a valid image, nothing will be opened. <filename> should contain a full or relative path to the file.

--keepopen -k Keep application open
Parameters:none
Keeps the application open after parsing the command line options.

--new -n Create a new image
Parameters:<format>
Creates a blank image file for format <format>:
<format> can be:
DFSS	: Acorn DFS single sided 80 track
DFSS40	: Acorn DFS single sided 40 track
DFSD	: Acorn DFS double sided 80 track
DFSD40	: Acorn DFS double sided 40 track

C1541	: Commodore 1541
C1571	: Commodore 1571
C1581	: Commodore 1581
AMIGADD	: Commodore Amiga DD
AMIGAHD	: Commodore Amiga HD
CFS	: Acorn Cassette Filing System

--opt -o Set boot option
Parameters:<opt>
Sets the boot option for the disc. <opt> can be:
0 or none	:	*OPT4,0
1 or load	:	*OPT4,1
2 or run	:	*OPT4,2
3 or exec	:	*OPT4,3

--opt1 -o1
Parameters:<opt>
Sets the boot option for the disc, side 1 (DFS double sided only). See above for options.

--rename -r Rename file or directory
Parameters:<oldfilename>|<newfilename>
Renames <oldfilename> to <newfilename> within the currently open image. <oldfilename> should be the complete path, while <newfilename> should just be the file's new name.

--save -s Save image file
Parameters:[<filename>][|<uncompress>]
Saves the currently open image file as <filename>. If <uncompress> is set to TRUE (for UEF) then the file will be saved uncompressed. If <uncompress> is specified for any other image type, then this is ignored. If <filename> is omitted, then the current file and path will be used. If this is a newly created image then the filename used will be Untitled, with the appropriate extension, and will be saved to the local folder.
This command is not entirely necessary as the image will be saved after all other commands have been run with the defaults for <filename> and <uncompress>.

--title -t Set disc title
Parameters:<disc title>
Sets the title for the disc

--title1 -t1 Set disc title for side 1
Parameters:<disc title>
Sets the title for the disc, side 1 (DFS double sided only).
