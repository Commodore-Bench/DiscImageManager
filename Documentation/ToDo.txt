To Do
-----
In no particular order

General
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Application to application communications.
* Duplicate files (i.e. like copy and rename into same directory) - just do this via file context menu, Image main menu and toolbar button.
* Copy entire files onto clipboard? And then paste from clipboard?
* For RISC OS applications, look inside for a sprite file to display instead of the standard RISC OS Application icon.
* Scaling - there is a report that icons 'grow' on scaled screens. I have been unable to reproduce this.
* Overhaul of the free-space display. It currently takes too long (especially for big drives) to create a graphic. Looking at ditching the idea of separating system areas, files and directories and just have free space and used space. I can then utilise the fragment arrays to pass this information up to the GUI.
