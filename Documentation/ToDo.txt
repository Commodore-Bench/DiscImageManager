To Do
-----
In no particular order

General
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Application to application communications.
* Duplicate files (i.e. like copy and rename into same directory) - just do this via file context menu, Image main menu and toolbar button.
* Copy entire files onto clipboard? And then paste from clipboard?
* For RISC OS applications, look inside for a sprite file to display instead of the standard RISC OS Application icon.
* Scaling - there is a report that icons 'grow' on scaled screens. I have been unable to reproduce this.

Command Line
none

Coding Issues
none

DFS
none

ADFS
* Looks like there is a bug involving directories getting broken and not detected. I suspect that the calculation for the checksum is incorrect.

Commodore
none

Amiga
* Write/Delete/Rename files/directories to Amiga images.
* Create blank Amiga images.
* Create Free Space Map for Amiga.
* Show file attributes in the File Details panel.

Spectrum/Amstrad
* Write entire module.

CFS
* Enable the code to move files - both this and the previous require the Drop and Drag to be enabled for CFS.
