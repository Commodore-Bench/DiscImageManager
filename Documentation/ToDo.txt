To Do
-----
In no particular order

General
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Application to application communications.
* Duplicate files (i.e. like copy and rename into same directory) - just do this via file context menu, Image main menu and toolbar button.
* Copy entire files onto clipboard? And then paste from clipboard?
* For RISC OS applications, look inside for a sprite file to display instead of the standard RISC OS Application icon.
* Scaling - there is a report that icons 'grow' on scaled screens. I have been unable to reproduce this.

Command Line

Coding Issues
none

DFS
none

ADFS
* Currently files are allocated fragments for new map starting from the root zone, then moving up and wrapping round (e.g. 2,3,0,1). ADFS tries to centralise around the root zone (e.g. 2,1,3,0). This is in ADFSGetFreeFragments.
* Currently multi-zone sized files are allocated fragments for new map starting from the root zone, but ADFS starts from zone 0 for such files.

Commodore
none

Amiga
* Write/Delete/Rename files/directories to Amiga images.
* Create blank Amiga images.
* Create Free Space Map for Amiga.
* Show file attributes in the File Details panel.

Spectrum/Amstrad
* Write entire module.

CFS
* Enable the code to move files - both this and the previous require the Drop and Drag to be enabled for CFS.
