To Do

In no particular order

Bugs
* Scaling - there is a report that icons 'grow' on scaled screens. I have been unable to reproduce this.
* File details tiling leaves empty areas after ejecting a disc while a file is selected.
* 'Bad FS Map' from BeebEm when loading an ADFS/AFS hybrid image after making a change to the ADFS partition. Unable to reproduce.
* Some SS DFS images are IDed as DS images when 'zero length images' is selected in the preferences.
* Potential bug (ADFS and AFS): A directory that has entries gets renamed. The Parent field of the entries still points to the old name, and the same for grandparents, etc.

General
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Application to application communications.
* Copy entire files onto clipboard? And then paste from clipboard?
* For RISC OS applications, look inside for a sprite file to display instead of the standard RISC OS Application icon.
* Ask to force overwrite if many files are getting written.
* Export the contents of an open image to another image, or set of images if the selected format is too small or are more directory entries than the format allows.
* Duplicate the facility to prevent infinite loops when reading images from Acorn FS to ADFS, Amiga and Spark.
* Cancel button for progress display?
* Tool to change the interleave of an image (ADFS L and AFS).
* Click on root to enable saving of just that partition/drive (splitting of a DS DFS) (REF:1).
* Click on root to enable deleting of partition (and splitting of a DS DFS) (REF:1).
* Import AFS into ADFS to create new partition (REF:1).
* Import SD DFS into SD DFS to create combined DS DFS (REF:1).
* Side pane (left hand side) to allow separate images to be opened (REF:3).
* Use side pane for opening MMFS images and remove the code from TDiscImage (REF:3).
* Add a new field to the TDirEntry: ParentRef...the reference to the object's parent. Then, add three new fields to the TDir: ParentRef, ParentEntry and Sector - the reference to the parent; the entry number in the parent; and the location in the image of the directory. Then implement it, throughout the code where possible, instead of using the Parent field of TDirEntry.
* Incorporate the Acorn FS capabilities to the command line options.

ADFS
* Change the size of the ADFS partition or image.
* Compact the free space map.
* Add option to create an AFS partition (REF:1).

Amiga
* Write/Delete/Rename files/directories to Amiga images.
* Create blank Amiga images.
* Create Free Space Map for Amiga.
* Show file attributes in the File Details panel.

Spectrum/Amstrad
* Write entire module.

MMFS
* Write entire module - remove from TDiscImage and incorporate into GUI (REF:3).

Spark
* Create new archive.
* Create directory.
* Write file.
* Rename file/directory.
* Delete file/directory.
* Move file.

Acorn File Store (AFS)
* Add a dialogue box to allow the entering of user accounts for the password file.
* Create blank ADFS/AFS L3 hybrid images (REF:1).
* Delete file/directory.
* Move file.
