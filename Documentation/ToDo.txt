To Do
-----
In no particular order

Bugs
* Scaling - there is a report that icons 'grow' on scaled screens. I have been unable to reproduce this.
* File details tiling leaves empty areas after ejecting a disc while a file is selected.
* 'Bad FS Map' from BeebEm when loading an ADFS/AFS hybrid image after making a change to the ADFS partition. Unable to reproduce.
* Some SS DFS images are IDed as DS images when 'zero length images' is selected in the preferences.

General
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Application to application communications.
* Copy entire files onto clipboard? And then paste from clipboard?
* For RISC OS applications, look inside for a sprite file to display instead of the standard RISC OS Application icon.
* Ask to force overwrite if many files are getting written.
* Export the contents of an open image to another image, or set of images if the selected format is too small or are more directory entries than the format allows.
* Cancel button for progress display?
* Tool to change the interleave of an image (ADFS L and AFS).
* Side pane (left hand side) to allow separate images to be opened (REF:3).
* Use side pane for opening MMFS images and remove the code from TDiscImage (REF:3).

ADFS
* Change the size of the ADFS partition or image (ideally, this can be done using a similar method to below - create a new image and import the contents into it).
* Compact the free space map (this can be done from the GUI - use method to create a new image, same size and format as current, then import the contents of the current image across).

Amiga
* Write/Delete/Rename files/directories to Amiga images.
* Create blank Amiga images.
* Create Free Space Map for Amiga.
* Show file attributes in the File Details panel.

Spectrum/Amstrad
* Write entire module.

MMFS
* Write entire module - remove from TDiscImage and incorporate into GUI (REF:3).

Spark
* Create new archive.
* Create directory.
* Write file.
* Rename file/directory.
* Delete file/directory.
* Move file.
