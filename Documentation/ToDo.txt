To Do

In no particular order

Bugs
* Scaling - there is a report that icons 'grow' on scaled screens. I have been unable to reproduce this.
  + This appears to happen on Windows (and probably Linux), with single screen only (dual or more it does not do this), resolution of 1400 by anything (or more), and scaled to more than 100%. The icons in the Directory Listing grow as the mouse moves. - TO BE TESTED
* 'Bad FS Map' from BeebEm when loading an ADFS/AFS hybrid image after making a change to the ADFS partition. - UNABLE TO REPLICATE
* Some SS DFS images are IDed as DS images when 'Allow zero sectors' is selected in the preferences.
* Access violation has been reported when creating an ADFS HDD image (default options) on Windows. - UNABLE TO REPLICATE
* Does not work on Windows 11. - UNABLE TO REPLICATE

General
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform. This will need to be done using 'code-per-platform' directives.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Application to application communications.
* Copy entire files onto clipboard? And then paste from clipboard? - as Drag and Drop, this will need to be done using 'code-per-platform' directives.
* Ask to force overwrite if many files are getting written.
* Export the contents of an open image to another image, or set of images if the selected format is too small or are more directory entries than the format allows.
* Cancel button for progress display?
* Open multiple images at the same time and allow interaction between them (e.g. copying files from one to another).
* For macOS, change the settings being saved to the registry to being saved in a plist file, or within the application directory itself.
* Ablity to add/remove/delete partitions using the command line.

DFS

ADFS
* Import an existing AFS or DOS image into ADFS as a new partition.

AFS
* AFS0 images do not get created correctly (in particular the free space allocation maps) - AWAITING MORE INFO ON AFS FORMATS.
* Add option to new Level 3 images for pre-1988 or post-1988 format - AWAITING MORE INFO ON AFS FORMATS.
* When extracting the AFS partition, remove the ADFS partition and re-address all the objects, instead of just blanking out the ADFS part - IN PROGRESS.

Amiga
* Write/Delete/Rename files/directories to Amiga images.
* Create blank Amiga images.
* Create Free Space Map for Amiga.
* Show file attributes in the File Details panel.

Spectrum/Amstrad
* Write entire module - REQUIRE MORE INFO ON SPECTRUM FORMAT.

MMFS
* Rewrite/rethink entire MMFS idea. Possibly remove from Disc Image Manager.

Spark
* Create new archive.
* Create directory.
* Write file.
* Rename file/directory.
* Delete file/directory.
* Move file.

DOS Plus
