To Do
-----
In no particular order

General
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Application to application communications.
* Copy entire files onto clipboard? And then paste from clipboard?
* For RISC OS applications, look inside for a sprite file to display instead of the standard RISC OS Application icon.
* Scaling - there is a report that icons 'grow' on scaled screens. I have been unable to reproduce this.
* File details tiling leaves empty areas after ejecting a disc while a file is selected.
* Ask to force overwrite if many files are getting written.
* Export the contents of an open image to another image, or set of images if the selected format is too small or are more directory entries than the format allows.
* Change the disc size/free space & disc name display depending on which drive is selected (drill up until the root is found to work out which drive/partition is selected) for Acorn DFS and Acorn ADFS/FS Hybrid.
* Duplicate the facility to prevent infinite loops when reading images from Acorn FS to ADFS, Amiga and Spark.
* Change variables disc_size/afs_disc_size, free_space/afs_free_space and disc_name to arrays.
* Utilise the above arrays for double sided DFS discs.

Amiga
* Write/Delete/Rename files/directories to Amiga images.
* Create blank Amiga images.
* Create Free Space Map for Amiga.
* Show file attributes in the File Details panel.

Spectrum/Amstrad
* Write entire module.

MMFS
* Write entire module.

Acorn File Store (AFS)
* Make writable.
