To Do
-----
In no particular order

General
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform.
* Double click on a file to open to display the contents as a hex dump.
* Conversion between formats - e.g. ssd to adf;adf to ssd;etc.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Extend copy/move for directories.

Command Line
* Extract files.

Coding Issues
* ID a file before loading, without trampling all over the currently loaded image (use a temporary second instance of TDiscImage).
* When moving files in ADFS, just move the directory entries.

DFS
* Convert dsd to two ssd.
* Merge two ssd to a single dsd.

ADFS
* Write/Delete/Rename files/directories to ADFS Big Dir images.
* Fix broken ADFS directories.
* Deleting a file which is a shared object will remove the fragment in the FSM, thereby effectively deleting all the shared objects.

Commodore
* Add support for Commodore 1541 images with 40 tracks.

Amiga
* Write/Delete/Rename files/directories to Amiga images.
* Create blank Amiga images.
* Create Free Space Map for Amiga.

Spectrum/Amstrad
* Write entire module.

CFS
* Write entire module.
