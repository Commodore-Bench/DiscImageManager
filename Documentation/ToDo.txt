To Do
-----
In no particular order

General
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Application to application communications.
* Duplicate files (i.e. like copy and rename into same directory) - just do this via file context menu, Image main menu and toolbar button.
* Copy entire files onto clipboard? And then paste from clipboard?
* For RISC OS applications, look inside for a sprite file to display instead of the standard RISC OS Application icon.
* Scaling - there is a report that icons 'grow' on scaled screens. I have been unable to reproduce this.
* File details tiling leaves empty areas after ejecting a disc while a file is selected.
* Add Settings window:
  + Threshold for switching to bypassing the GUI upon Spark import.
  + Force an ADFS L to be either interleaved, non-interleaved or auto-detect.
  + Change the tile for the windows' background.
* When importing the contents of a Spark archive, or another image, open another dialogue to allow the user to 'pick and choose' which file(s) they wish to import.
