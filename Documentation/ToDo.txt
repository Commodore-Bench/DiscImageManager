In no particular order

General
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Application to application communications.
* Copy entire files onto clipboard? And then paste from clipboard?
* For RISC OS applications, look inside for a sprite file to display instead of the standard RISC OS Application icon.
* Scaling - there is a report that icons 'grow' on scaled screens. I have been unable to reproduce this.
* File details tiling leaves empty areas after ejecting a disc while a file is selected.
* Add option to specify the creating of inf files.
* Add more tiling options, including 'none'.
* Ask to force overwrite if many files are getting written.

* Create blank Amiga images.
* Create Free Space Map for Amiga.
* Show file attributes in the File Details panel.
