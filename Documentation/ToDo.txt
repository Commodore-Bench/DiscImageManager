To Do
-----
In no particular order

General
* Drag and Drop facilities out of the application...currently looking unlikely for cross platform.
* Extend drag and drop copy/move to multiple selection.
* Application to application communications.
* Duplicate files (i.e. like copy and rename into same directory) - just do this via file context menu, Image main menu and toolbar button.
* Copy entire files onto clipboard? And then paste from clipboard?

Command Line
none

Coding Issues
none

DFS
* MMB Explorer?
  + Used as a separate window, but double clicking on an entry will load this into the main window.
  + Add an extra option to save back (as save will just save to the OS hard drive).

ADFS
* Write/Delete/Rename files/directories to ADFS Big Dir images - act on the root directory. Code is written, with supporting functions changed, with the lock removed, but has not been tested.

Commodore
none

Amiga
* Write/Delete/Rename files/directories to Amiga images.
* Create blank Amiga images.
* Create Free Space Map for Amiga.
* Show file attributes in the File Details panel.

Spectrum/Amstrad
* Write entire module.

CFS
* Enable the code to move files - both this and the previous require the Drop and Drag to be enabled for CFS.
