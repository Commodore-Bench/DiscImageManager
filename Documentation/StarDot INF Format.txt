<filename> <load> <exec> <length> <access> <extra info>

Where:
Each field separated by at least one space.
<filename> is the original BBC filename. Quotes are optional, but mandatory if the filename contains spaces.
<load> is the file's load address in hex.
<exec> is the file's execution address in hex.
<length> is the file's length in hex.
<access> can be either the access letters (L for DFS, LWRElwre for ADFS), or hex number according to OSFILE API.
Bit  Meaning
---  -------
0    Readable by you
1    Writable by you
2    Executable by you
3    Not deletable by you (locked on DFS)
4    Readable by others (NFS, not 8-bit ADFS)
5    Writable by others (NFS, not 8-bit ADFS)
6    Executable by others (NFS, not 8-bit ADFS)
7    Not deletable by others (NFS, not 8-bit ADFS)
<extra info> is tag value pairs, using quotes where applicable (i.e. contains spaces) for any extra information.
The filename for the host filing system (e.g. Windows) should be valid for that system (using the algorithm in JGH's post), with the .inf file matching.
BBC <-> DOS
  # <-> ?
  . <-> /
  $ <-> <
  ^ <-> >
  & <-> +
  @ <-> =
  % <-> ;

Applicable to both files and directories.

Incidentally, I don't think you need to specify that a file is a directory, as the directory will be there, with the inf file following it. So when you find a directory, like files, look for <directory name>.inf.

Also - top bit set characters in filenames: these are allowed from ADFS D (IIRC) onwards. Indeed, Archimedes Elite's application name uses an accented 'e'.
