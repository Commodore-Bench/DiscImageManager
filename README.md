# Disc Image Manager
Disc Image Manager is an application used to load a retro disc image, read the catalogue and output any required files. In addition, it will also add files to the image, delete, and rename files and directories. So far, the following formats are supported:<br>
• Acorn DFS (Acorn and Watford formats) - Read and Write<br>
• Acorn ADFS, floppy formats S, M, L, D, E, E+, F, F+ and Hard Discs - Read and Write (not E+, F+ or big directory hard discs)<br>
• Commodore 1541 (not 40 track) - Read and Write<br>
• Commodore 1571 - Read and Write<br>
• Commodore 1581 - Read and Write<br>
• Commodore AmigaDOS floppy and hard discs - Read Only<br>
• Acorn Cassette Filing System (CFS) - Read and Write<br>
<br>
For images in HFE format, I recommend you use HxC Floppy Emulator (https://sourceforge.net/projects/hxcfloppyemu/) to export the file in a format that Disc Image Manager understands.<br>
<br>
Another project that may interest users of Disc Image Manager is a test tool I wrote for UEF files - UEF Reader (https://github.com/geraldholdsworth/UEFReader). In addition, I'm developing a RISC OS sprite to bitmap/PNG converter here (https://github.com/geraldholdsworth/SpriteToBitmap), which may make itself into Disc Image Manager. One project that has made it into Disc Image Manager, as a cut down version, is here (https://github.com/geraldholdsworth/FileDump).<br>
<br>
Project was written in Lazarus (https://www.lazarus-ide.org). Binaries are available for macOS 32 and 64 bit, Windows 32 and 64 bit, Linux 32 and 64 bit, and Raspbian 32 bit (Linux ARM 32 bit). Full source is available if you wish to compile for other systems.<br>
